## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects:  

  - **COVID-19 Analysis -** Created a **Dashboard** and **Storyboard** showing the Spread of **COVID-19 Cases** in the Country and other Regions. Also, **Identified** interesting **Patterns** and **Possible Reasons** for the Spread of COVID-19 using **Tableau**

  - **Decision Tree Classification -** Created **Decision Tree Classifier** and visualized it graphically using **Decision Tree** algorithm with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others

 - **Retail Analysis -** Predicted **Weak Areas** where we can work to make more **Profit** and created **Dashboards** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and others

  - **Sports Analysis -** Predicted the **Most Successful Teams**, **Players**, and **Factors** Contributing Win or Loss of a Team and created **Storyboards** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others

 - **Stock Market Prediction -** Predicted a **Hybrid Model** for **Stock Market Performance** using **Numerical Analysis** of Historical Stock Prices and **Sentiment Analysis** of News Headlines with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and others

  - **Supervised Classification -** Predicted **Percentage** of a **Student** based on the number of **Study Hours** and **Score** if a Student studied for 9.25 hours/day using **Linear** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others

  - **Terrorism Analysis -** Predicted **Hot Zones** of **Terrorism** and created **Storyboards** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others
  
  - **Unsupervised Classification -** Predicted **Optimal Number** of **Clusters** and represented it visually using **K-means Clustering** algorithm with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others
